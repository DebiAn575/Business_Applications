## Capstone Initiation - Home Credit Default Risk Prediction 
### Business Description
Home Credit is an international consumer finance provider focused on responsible lending primarily to people with little or no credit history. As the company provides financial support for home purchasers the company makes sure that they are lending the money to the right and responsible clients, who have the ability to repay the loan amount. Home Credit wants to use various statistical and predictive analysis methods on the requester data collected previously and current data to unearth the credibility of a requester by predicting whether they would be able to repay the entire loan with interest in due course of time i.e. predict whether an applicant is likely to default. 

### Analytical Approach
#### 1. Understanding Data sets provided 
In this project, there are 8 CSV files that we have used. 
application_train.csv - data set for training model
application_test.csv - data set for testing 
bureau.csv
bureau_balance.csv
credit_card_balance.csv
installments_payments.csv
POS_CASH_balance.csv
previous_application.csv

The target variable identified here is whether the requester will default or not. A simple binary variable Target with values 1 (if the requester has had difficulties in payment previously) and 0 (for all other situations) assessing closely the credibility of a requester can be statistically analyzed and a predictive model can be developed through classification algorithms.
