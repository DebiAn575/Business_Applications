## Capstone Initiation - Home Credit Default Risk Prediction 
### Business Description
Home Credit is an international consumer finance provider focused on responsible lending primarily to people with little or no credit history. As the company provides financial support for home purchasers the company makes sure that they are lending the money to the right and responsible clients, who have the ability to repay the loan amount. Home Credit wants to use various statistical and predictive analysis methods on the requester data collected previously and current data to unearth the credibility of a requester by predicting whether they would be able to repay the entire loan with interest in due course of time i.e. predict whether an applicant is likely to default.
